<description>A lightweight fighter known for it's speed and sadly it's fragility. Depend on your agility rather then your armor. It's weapon system is ... adequate.</description>

<description>A juggernaught amongst fighters. It's cannon can wreck just about anything in short notice. It's armor is comparable to that of heavier class vessels. Don't expect to go anywhere fast however.</description>
